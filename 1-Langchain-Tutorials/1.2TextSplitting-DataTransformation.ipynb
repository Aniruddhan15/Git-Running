Our graduate programs are designed to prepare graduates for a wide range of opportunities in local, \\nnational, and international settings.\\nI am  pleased to offer you admission to the Master of Science program in Applied Machine Learning for Fall 2025.\\nYour tuition and charge-differential classification: Out-of-State\\nYour condition(s) of enrollment:\\nâ€¢ Submission of final official baccalaureate transcript(s) from all previous institutions by the end of the first semester of \\nstudy.\\nEach required transcript (except from the University of Maryland College Park) must show the date and conferral of the \\nawarded degree. If your transcript does not state that a degree was granted, an attested copy of your diploma/degree \\ncertificate is required. Future registration will not be possible without the receipt of these documents.\\nOfficial electronic transcripts may be sent directly from your institution to the following email address: gradschool@umd.edu. \\nOtherwise, you may mail your official unopened/sealed transcript to the following address:\\nUniversity of Maryland\\nEnrollment Service Operations\\nATTN: Transcript for Graduate Admission\\nRoom 3125 Mitchell Building\\nCollege Park, Maryland 20742, USA\\nPlease follow each step in the Checklist for New Students to prepare you for your first semester at the University of \\nMaryland. All full-time graduate students are required to have health insurance. If you will not be covered under someone  \\nelse's plan (a parent or spouse), please explore your health insurance options before the term starts. If you believe that the \\ntuition and charge-differential classification is incorrect, please contact the Residency Classification Office \\n(resclass@umd.edu).\\nIt is important to accept or decline this admission offer. Your University ID (UID) is 121955555. You will need this number for \\nregistration and other administrative purposes. The \\nInternational Student and Scholar Services office will contact you directly \\nregarding the visa process.\\nAgain, we welcome you to the University of Maryland, with our best wishes for a successful and rewarding graduate \\nexperience.\"),\n",
